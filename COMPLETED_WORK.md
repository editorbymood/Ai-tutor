## 🎯 How Everything Connects

### User Authentication Flow
```
User → views.login_user() → authenticate() 
     → RefreshToken.for_user() → JWT tokens → Response
```

### Course Enrollment Flow
```
Student → views.enroll_course() → Enrollment.create() 
        → update_lesson_progress() → LessonProgress.save()
```

### Quiz Attempt Flow
```
Student → start_quiz_attempt() → QuizAttempt.create()
        → submit_answer() → QuestionResponse.create()
        → complete_quiz() → calculate_score()
```

### AI Chat Flow
```
User → send_chat_message() → gemini_service.chat()
     → Redis cache check → Gemini API → save response
```
